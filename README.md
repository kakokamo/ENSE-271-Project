# Project Description

Non-profit organizations are vital for assisting communities, yet they frequently face challenges in obtaining the resources and information necessary for effective operations. Numerous charities in Saskatchewan encounter obstacles like restricted funding, small staff sizes, and trouble locating dependable resources for strategy development, fundraising, and compliance. To tackle this problem, the South Saskatchewan Community Foundation (SSCF) is creating a Charity Resource Hub—an online centralized platform designed to give registered charities and non-profits access to essential resources, educational materials, grant opportunities, and networking tools. 

This initiative intends to develop an easy-to-navigate and accessible web platform that enables organizations to effectively find trustworthy, locally pertinent information on subjects like human resources, financial management, fundraising, marketing, and legal compliance. The hub will provide event listings, grant-writing resources, and recordings of educational webinars to assist charities in enhancing their influence. 

In a course-based learning initiative, our team will work alongside SSCF to investigate creative web design strategies, utilizing an Agile/Design Thinking methodology. The project will be developed utilizing Figma, WordPress, Local by Flywheel, GitHub, and various other industry-standard tools. By making the platform accessible and organized, we seek to offer a lasting solution that assists non-profits in Saskatchewan for many years ahead.
